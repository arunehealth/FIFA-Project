# FIFA-Project
“ML model to predict the FIFA world cup 2018”

This project was the final project done for the course “Python for Data Science” done at ReDI school, Berlin. This was a group project done with the help of the 2 of my team members and mentors.

Objective of the model:
To predict the results of the matches in the FIFA world cup 2018.

Overview:
Supervised learning method was used.
Set of predictors used (independent variables):
Team ranking
Player ranking
Historical data from previous encounters
ML algorithms used: Logistic regression, Decision trees and Random forests

Steps of the project:
Data collection:
Data was collected from the following websites:
sofifa.com
fifaranking.com
Scrapping of the data was done with the help of beautifulsoup package of python

Data cleaning:
Done using a Jupiter notebook
Cleaned manually for null values
Only data for the last 4 world cup matches were used 

Data accentuation:
To avoid less data for the model
Data was mirrored to increase the number of data sets

Model application:
Packages used:
Pandas, numpy and scikit, sklearn
Sklearn import packages: 
Linear_model
LogisitcRegression
Tree

Model accuracy score = 0.56
